# NodeJS Dashboard Example
This is a dashboard that I built in NodeJS that pulls data from a CSV file and creates visualizations. The data used was taken from the U.S. Govt open data portal and showcases their expenditure by department. Being open data, the information in the dataset had to be cleaned by me and is not accurate so please don't use this as an accurate account.
